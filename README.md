Campus Mapping Tool

The Campus Mapping Tool is a project developed in C++ and Python aimed at providing efficient navigation solutions within a college campus environment. The tool incorporates custom XML and CSV file parsers designed from scratch to process location data and bus stop information specific to the college town.

Key Features:

Custom File Parsers: The project includes custom parsers for XML and CSV files to extract and process location data and bus stop information relevant to the college campus.

Graph Theory Algorithms: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm and other graph theory techniques to calculate the shortest routes between any given campus location or bus stop. These algorithms ensure efficient navigation options for users.

Comparative Testing: The project includes comparative testing against real Google Maps queries to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the route calculations. This ensures that the navigation solutions provided by the tool are reliable and practical.

Collaborative Development with Docker: Leveraged Docker for streamlined project development within a team environment. Docker containers provide a consistent and isolated environment for development, testing, and deployment of the Campus Mapping Tool.

Overall, the Campus Mapping Tool offers a comprehensive solution for navigating college campuses efficiently, providing users with reliable route information and enhancing their overall experience within the campus environment.
